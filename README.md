## üöÄ Overview

**Created by AI** to address the inadequacy of Autodesk's official removal methods. After Autodesk discontinued their comprehensive "Autodesk Uninstall Tool" and replaced it with [limited manual instructions](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Clean-uninstall.html), users were left without a reliable way to completely remove Autodesk software.

This AI-developed tool provides a complete solution for removing all traces of Autodesk software from Windows systems. It goes beyond standard uninstallation and Autodesk's insufficient manual methods by removing:

- **All Autodesk applications** (AutoCAD, Inventor, Maya, 3ds Max, Revit, Fusion 360, etc.)
- **Services and processes** (including licensing services)
- **Registry entries** (software keys, file associations, installer entries)
- **Files and directories** (program files, user data, temp files, cache)
- **Shortcuts** (desktop, start menu, taskbar, quick launch)
- **System files** (MSI cache, prefetch files, event logs)
- **Network settings** (firewall rules, hosts file cleanup)

## üôè Acknowledgments

- **Created by AI** in response to Autodesk's inadequate removal solutions
- Developed after Autodesk discontinued their comprehensive "Autodesk Uninstall Tool"
- Inspired by the need for a reliable alternative to Autodesk's [limited manual cleanup instructions](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Clean-uninstall.html)
- Thanks to the PowerShell community for best practices and techniques
- Built with safety, thoroughness, and user needs in mind - something Autodesk failed to provide

## ü§ñ Why This AI Tool Was Created

### The Problem with Autodesk's Solutions
Autodesk previously provided a comprehensive "Autodesk Uninstall Tool" that could effectively remove their software. However, they **discontinued this tool** and now only provide [basic manual cleanup instructions](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Clean-uninstall.html) that are:

- ‚ùå **Incomplete** - Leaves behind hundreds of files and registry entries
- ‚ùå **Manual** - Requires users to manually delete files and edit registry
- ‚ùå **Time-consuming** - Takes hours of manual work
- ‚ùå **Error-prone** - Easy to miss components or damage system
- ‚ùå **Unsafe** - No backup or recovery options provided

### The AI Solution
This tool was developed by AI to provide what Autodesk failed to deliver:

- ‚úÖ **Complete removal** of all Autodesk components
- ‚úÖ **Automated process** with minimal user intervention  
- ‚úÖ **Safety features** including restore points and backups
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive cleanup** beyond what Autodesk's manual method covers
- ‚úÖ **Error handling** and recovery procedures
- ‚úÖ **User-friendly interface** with clear feedback

**The result**: A tool that actually works and removes Autodesk software completely, something Autodesk themselves no longer provides.
