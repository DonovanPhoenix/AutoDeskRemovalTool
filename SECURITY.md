## Security Considerations

### System Impact
This tool makes extensive changes to Windows systems including:
- **System Registry modifications**
- **File and directory deletion**
- **Service management**
- **Network configuration changes**
- **System restore point creation**

### Built-in Security Features
- **Administrator privilege verification**
- **System safety checks** (Domain Controller detection)
- **Automatic backup creation** (system restore points)
- **Safe file operations** with proper error handling
- **User confirmation prompts** for dangerous operations

### Recommended Security Practices

#### Before Running
- [ ] **Test in isolated environment** first
- [ ] **Create full system backup** (beyond restore points)
- [ ] **Run on non-production systems** initially
- [ ] **Verify script integrity** before execution
- [ ] **Close all applications** and save work

#### During Execution
- [ ] **Monitor the process** for unexpected behavior
- [ ] **Don't interrupt** the script during execution
- [ ] **Run from secure location** (not downloads folder)
- [ ] **Ensure stable power supply** during operation

#### After Execution
- [ ] **Verify system functionality** after restart
- [ ] **Check for unexpected system changes**
- [ ] **Test critical applications** and services
- [ ] **Monitor system performance** for issues

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### What to Report
Please report security vulnerabilities for:
- **Code injection possibilities**
- **Privilege escalation issues**
- **Unsafe file operations**
- **Registry security problems**
- **System stability concerns**

### How to Report
1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email** the maintainers directly (create an issue asking for contact info)
3. **Include** detailed information about the vulnerability
4. **Provide** steps to reproduce the issue
5. **Suggest** possible fixes if you have them

### Information to Include
- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Potential impact** on system security
- **Affected versions** of the tool
- **System configuration** where found
- **Proof of concept** (if applicable)

## Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix development**: Within 2 weeks (depending on severity)
- **Release**: As soon as possible after fix verification

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Before Installation
```powershell
# Check PowerShell execution policy
Get-ExecutionPolicy

# Verify file integrity (if hash provided)
Get-FileHash -Path "AutoDeskRemovalTool.ps1" -Algorithm SHA256

# Check for digital signatures
Get-AuthenticodeSignature -Path "AutoDeskRemovalTool.ps1"
```

### Safe Execution
```powershell
# Always run as administrator
Start-Process PowerShell -Verb RunAs

# Use full path to script
& "C:\TrustedLocation\AutoDeskRemovalTool.ps1"

# Review parameters before using Force mode
& "C:\TrustedLocation\AutoDeskRemovalTool.ps1" -Force
```

### Post-Execution Verification
```powershell
# Check system integrity
sfc /scannow

# Verify Windows Update functionality
Get-WindowsUpdate

# Check for remaining Autodesk components
Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "*Autodesk*"}
```

## Known Security Considerations

### System Modifications
- **Registry changes**: Extensive registry modifications are made
- **File system changes**: Files and directories are permanently deleted
- **Service modifications**: Windows services are stopped and removed
- **Network changes**: Firewall rules and network settings are reset

### Potential Risks
- **Data loss**: If important data is stored in Autodesk directories
- **System instability**: If other applications depend on Autodesk components
- **Network connectivity**: If custom network configurations are reset
- **Application compatibility**: If shared components are removed

### Mitigation Strategies
- **System restore points**: Automatically created before changes
- **Backup verification**: Hosts file and other critical files backed up
- **Safety checks**: Multiple validation steps before execution
- **User confirmations**: Interactive prompts for dangerous operations

## Secure Development Practices

### Code Security
- **Input validation**: All user inputs are validated
- **Path sanitization**: File paths are properly sanitized
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling prevents crashes
- **Privilege checks**: Administrator privileges verified before execution

### Testing Security
- **Isolated testing**: All testing done in isolated environments
- **Multiple OS versions**: Tested on various Windows versions
- **Edge cases**: Unusual system configurations tested
- **Recovery testing**: System recovery procedures verified

## Compliance and Auditing

### Audit Trail
The tool provides:
- **Detailed logging** of all operations
- **User confirmation records** for dangerous operations
- **System change documentation** through restore points
- **Error logging** for troubleshooting

### Compliance Considerations
- **Change management**: Document all system changes
- **Backup procedures**: Ensure proper backup before execution
- **Testing requirements**: Test in non-production environments
- **Approval processes**: Follow organizational change approval processes
